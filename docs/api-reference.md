| **brainstormer** | Use this agent when you need to brainstorm software solutions, evaluate architectural approaches, or debate technical decisions before implementation. Examples: - <example>
    Context: User wants to add a new feature to their application
    user: "I want to add real-time notifications to my web app"
    assistant: "Let me use the brainstormer agent to explore the best approaches for implementing real-time notifications"
    <commentary>
    The user needs architectural guidance for a new feature, so use the brainstormer to evaluate options like WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, or push notifications.
    </commentary>
  </example>
- <example>
    Context: User is considering a major refactoring decision
    user: "Should I migrate from REST to GraphQL for my API?"
    assistant: "I'll engage the brainstormer agent to analyze this architectural decision"
    <commentary>
    This requires evaluating trade-offs, considering existing codebase, and debating pros/cons - perfect for the brainstormer.
    </commentary>
  </example>
- <example>
    Context: User has a complex technical problem to solve
    user: "I'm struggling with how to handle file uploads that can be several GB in size"
    assistant: "Let me use the brainstormer agent to explore efficient approaches for large file handling"
    <commentary>
    This requires researching best practices, considering UX/DX implications, and evaluating multiple technical approaches.
    </commentary>
